## ```color definitions```

## Build Instructions 
to build, run ```make```.
feel free to modify the makefile,
i have it configured in such a way where the resulting binary 
```city``` is linked to ```/tmp/bin/city```, and if this directory
does not exist, we ```mkdir -p /tmp/bin/city```.
in terms of a compiiler, in this ```makefile``` i am using ```cc``` for portability,
and the project was mainly intended to 
operate in symbiosis with the greater llvm ecosystem

# ```luajit``` or ```python3```
> cityshell was intended to be scripted in lua, but accepts python3
